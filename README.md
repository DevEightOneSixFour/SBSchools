Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions
REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. 
If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. 
Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. 
Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).

Create a native app to provide information on NYC High schools.
1. Display a list of NYC High Schools. 
   - Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
2. Selecting a school should show additional information about the school 
   - Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 
   - SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
3. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display
      When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
      YYYYMMDD-[First&LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-NYCSchools)
      In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, 
         try to prioritize the following:
      What is Important
      •	Proper function – requirements met.
      •	Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds 
          made in the interest of expediency 
          (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
      •	Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
      •	Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

      What is Less Important
      •	Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.

      Bonus Points!
      •	Unit Tests
      •	Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.
